# XML-RPC-_FileTransfer
A P2P program based on XML-RPC to realize remote file transfer.
The main functions of this program is as follows:

1. Every single node has the ability to introduce itself to other nodes and establish contact.

2. Every node can request for docuements from other nodes, including text files, audio files.

A schematic diagram is shown as follows:

In order to test the performance of the program. I started up three different nodes on the local computer and the port numbers are:

localhost:6741

localhost:6742

localhost:6743

respectively.
